                <h3>1. Difference between local storage and session storage ?</h3>
                <div>
                    <h5>Answer:</h5>


                    <p>
                        <span class="fw-bold">The one major difference between local Storage and session Storage is the
                            expiration date.</span> <br>

                        <span class="fw-bold">Local Storage</span> persists the storage across browser sessions. So even
                        if the domain is opened in a new tab, or the browser is closed and reopened, the storage is
                        saved. There is no expiration. <br>

                        <span class="fw-bold">Session Storage</span> is cleared when the page session ends. A page
                        session lasts as long as the tab or the browser is open. Therefore, when you open a new tab or a
                        new window, this creates a new session and new storage.

                <h3>2. Difference between global scope and block scope ?</h3>
                <h5>Answer:</h5>

                <p>
                    <span class="fw-bold">Global Scope</span>
                    Variables declared Globally (outside any function) have Global Scope.
                    Global variables can be accessed from anywhere in a JavaScript program.
                    Variables declared with var, let and const are quite similar when declared outside a block.
                    They all have Global Scope. <br>
                    <span class="fw-bold">Block Scope:</span> This scope restricts the variable that is declared inside
                    a specific block, from access by the outside of the block. The let & const keyword facilitates the
                    variables to be block scoped. In order to access the variables of that specific block, we need to
                    create an object for it. Variables declared with the var keyword, do not have block scope.

                <h3>3. How does work js event loop ?</h3>
                <h5>Answer:</h5>
                <p>
                    The Event Loop has one simple job — to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call
                    Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call
                    Stack, which effectively runs it. <br>

                    <span class="fw-bold">In another words</span><br>
                    The event loop is a mechanism that allows JavaScript to perform non-blocking operations. When an
                    asynchronous task is started, the event loop will start running. Once the task is completed, the
                    event loop will again check for any other tasks that need to be performed. This process will
                    continue until all tasks have been completed.

                <h3>How many way we got undefined ?</h3>
                <h5>Answer:</h5>


                <p>
                    1. When you declare a variable and don’t initialize it to a value, the variable will have a value of
                    undefined. <br>
                    2. If you access a non-existing property of an object, you’ll get undefined. <br>
                    3. When you call a function with a number of parameters, you often pass the same number of
                    arguments.
                    If the function has two parameters. When calling it, you can pass two arguments
                    But when you call the function and don’t pass all the arguments, the parameters inside the function
                    becomes undefined. <br>
                    4. A function that doesn’t have a return statement implicitly returns undefined, <br>
                    Likewise, when a function has a return statement without an expression, it also returns undefined
                    5. When you access an array element that is out-of-bounds, you’ll get the undefined value.
